A new concept that I've learnt while completing this task was creating a navigation bar that has links to sections within the same page. This was an indication to me that the navigation bar is versatile and doesn't 
just have a singular function. I've also learnt how to add copyright into my website.

I didn't encounter any difficulties as I made use of neccessary resources which assisted me with every step. The websites I used include websites web.dev/learn/css and html.com as well as youtube videos.
The external help I recieved taught me skills such as navigation bars in more detail, linking fonts into my html and css workspace, etc. I browsed through Behance to get inspiration on how to go about in completing 
this task as it is my first time working on a personal portfolio website. 

If I had more time I would have added images to make the website more visually appealing but other than that I believe I delivered what was required.
