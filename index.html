        <h2>I'm Alex Collins A Creative Web Developer.</h2>

            <p>I stepped into the web development field because it unleashed my potential and passion for building creative, 
            functional and interactive websites that enhance a users' digital experience.</p>

            <p>My goals are to solve problems by creating meaningful projects that make a real difference. 
            I also aim to improve the user's online experience by constantly refining my skills and learning new technologies. </p>

            <p>My passions are to collaborate with other developers, both those who are established and who are upcoming, such as myself, to share ideas, to improve our skills and for personal growth. 
            I also want to afford small businesses the opportunity to market themselves and to have an online presence so that they can grow their business.</p>
